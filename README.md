# MyChatbot

A lightweight natural language chatbot built in Python to understand user input, analyze sentiment or intent, and respond accordingly.  

---

## 📝 Introduction

MyChatbot serves as an accessible conversational agent for users to interact with text data. Whether you want to analyze sentiment (positive, negative, neutral), query information, or just experiment with simple NLP features — this chatbot offers a clean baseline to build on.

It helps by:

- Interpreting user text and classifying sentiment or intent  
- Responding with relevant messages or analytics  
- Serving as a foundation you can expand with more NLP models, integrations, or UI layers
